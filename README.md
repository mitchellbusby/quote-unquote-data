# sydcity

A GovHack 2019 project.

From our project description:
> How do the suburbs of Sydney interact and evolve? We explore the city through the lens of genetic algorithms, evolving new suburbs to compare and contrast with the existing social and cultural landscapes of the city.

We built a Simcity-esque suburb visualisation engine, scrapping together data from a few different statistical sources to try and cobble together a rudimentary distillation of a suburb.

## Project layout

### app

The guts of the project; this holds the front-end and back-end web app, hosted with Flask + ParcelJS. Check the readme in the folder on how to host it.


### processing

This contains a bunch of data files and Jupyter notebooks we used to process the models used in the app.
